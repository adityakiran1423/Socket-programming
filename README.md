# Socket programming  
 Server side : This is a simple server program in C language that listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port, accepts the connection, and then exchanges data with the client until the client sends the message "Bye" indicating that it wishes to terminate the connection.
 
Client side : This is a C program that creates a client socket and connects to a server using TCP/IP protocol. It takes two command-line arguments, the hostname of the server and the port number to connect to.
